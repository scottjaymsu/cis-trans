@article{ANWAR201747,
	abstract = {Transformations in the solid state are of considerable interest, both for fundamental reasons and because they underpin important technological applications. The interest spans a wide spectrum of disciplines and application domains. For pharmaceuticals, a common issue is unexpected polymorphic transformation of the drug or excipient during processing or on storage, which can result in product failure. A more ambitious goal is that of exploiting the advantages of metastable polymorphs (e.g. higher solubility and dissolution rate) while ensuring their stability with respect to solid state transformation. To address these issues and to advance technology, there is an urgent need for significant insights that can only come from a detailed molecular level understanding of the involved processes. Whilst experimental approaches at best yield time- and space-averaged structural information, molecular simulation offers unprecedented, time-resolved molecular-level resolution of the processes taking place. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical account of state-of-the-art methods for modelling polymorph stability and transitions between solid phases. This is flanked by revisiting the associated macroscopic theoretical framework for phase transitions, including their classification, proposed molecular mechanisms, and kinetics. The simulation methods are presented in tutorial form, focusing on their application to phase transition phenomena. We describe molecular simulation studies for crystal structure prediction and polymorph screening, phase coexistence and phase diagrams, simulations of crystal-crystal transitions of various types (displacive/martensitic, reconstructive and diffusive), effects of defects, and phase stability and transitions at the nanoscale. Our selection of literature is intended to illustrate significant insights, concepts and understanding, as well as the current scope of using molecular simulations for understanding polymorphic transitions in an accessible way, rather than claiming completeness. With exciting prospects in both simulation methods development and enhancements in computer hardware, we are on the verge of accessing an unprecedented capability for designing and developing dosage forms and drug delivery systems in silico, including tackling challenges in polymorph control on a rational basis.},

@article{Azam2014,
	abstract = {The enzyme sterol 24-C-methyltransferase (SMT) belongs to the family of transferases, specifically to the one-carbon transferring methyltransferases. SMT has been found playing a major role during the production of steroids, especially for the biosynthesis of ergosterol, which is the major membrane sterol in leishmania parasites, causing leishmaniasis. However, SMT and ergosterol are not found in mammals, so, an extensive study has been carried out over the susceptible SMT protein, which is found to be highly conserved among all the Leishmania species and holds a significant anti-leishmanial drug target. To date, there is no computational data available for SMT, due to its highly unexplored profile. In this work, a complete set of structural attributes have been examined through the available computational procedures, along with an attempt to characterize the most capable modeling server available. The exploration ranges from physicochemical characterization, pairwise alignment, secondary structure prediction, to active site detection. With this information, a docking study was carried out to find the compound that best binds into the active site. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to examine the stability of the homology modeled protein and the ligand-enzyme complex. The results indicate that the ligand-enzyme complex is more stable.},

	abstract = {N-Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT), despite having medical significance and structural complexity, has not been explored at any level yet and thus, it is a topic of extensive research. Comparative modeling helped in building the structures. Comparative modeling has been tweaked at various levels and different computational tools were employed to explore the proteins at residual level. ASMT was constructed through MODELLER, minimized by using different force field and then active site determination has been carried out. Production run of 10 ns is done and the time dependant behavior of protein on different timescales has been noticed through root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF). Results from ASMT yielded that the RMSD values have fluctuated and remained stable afterwards. These findings suggest that first hundred residues are responsible for the structurally and dynamically abnormal behavior of ASMT. RMSF values obtained through simulation were also consistent with these findings and a unique structure with first hundred residues, more flexible than the rest of structure, is observed for the first time in ASMT. This can also provide a new basis for the interpretation of catalytic and pharmacological properties with mechanistic explanation for this protein. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
